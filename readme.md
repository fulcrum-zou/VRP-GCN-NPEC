# VRP-GCN-NPEC

This is an implementation of the model GCN-NPEC in [Efficiently solving the practical vehicle routing problem: A novel joint learning approach](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3394486.3403356). It solves vehicle routing problem using deep learning methods combined with reinforcement learning. We use PyTorch as the framework.
